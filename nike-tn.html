        If you’re looking for a pair of sneakers that’ll ensure you make a statement, look no further than a pair of TNs. Forming an essential part of Nike’s Air Max legacy, the TN (aka the Air Max Plus) has been a street staple for years, but that’s a far cry from the original palm trees and sunset skies that inspired the silhouette. In fact, the TN has a few surprising facts behind it, so sit tight while we give you a quick little history lesson on the fan-fave sneaker.
        The original Nike Air Max Plus Tuned 1 was designed in 1998 by Sean McDowell, but the silhouette came about from a 1997 project named Sky Air, that Nike was working on with none other than Foot Locker. The idea was to create a new running shoe that would use Tuned Air technology – the latest in a long line of innovations from the Air Max family. Nike had presented over 15 proposals to Foot Locker before McDowell’s design won them over, but the process wasn't all smooth sailing.

        Though it's fair to say that the TN design has always been divisive, if you peek closer at a pair you’ll be able to notice a couple of details that make the model special. The lateral Swoosh is actually a little slimmer and longer than the standard logo, and this was thanks to the fact that McDowell has freestyled the design as no one had yet shown him exactly how to draw it. Of course, the rest of the shoe is equally as unique-looking, from the plastic exoskeleton that calls back to the palms, to the gradient upper, to its signature shank that divides the front and back Air Units – the inspiration drawn from a whale’s tail.
        While the TN remains one of Nike’s most popular models, cultural biases have managed to skew the perception of the shoe, but tracing the process back to its conception, the TN has always been a bit of a disruptor at heart. Not only was the Swoosh a little off, but McDowell saw the creation of the sneaker as a chance to challenge Nike lore. As a runner, he found it odd that reflective elements were put on the back of the shoes, when really, you should run facing traffic for better visibility, which would require reflective elements all the way up the front. The TN therefore saw reflective detailing dress the tongue and toe box – one of the shoe’s most popular and distinguishing details.
